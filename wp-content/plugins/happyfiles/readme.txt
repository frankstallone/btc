Organize your entire media library into folders in a matter of minutes.

== Description ==

HappyFiles helps you organize all of your WordPress media files into folders/categories.

Arrange your files as you would do on your computer: via simple, intuitive, and fast drag & drop.

HappyFiles uses custom taxonomy terms for its media folders. It doesn't modify any file paths, nor does it create any actual folders on your server.
