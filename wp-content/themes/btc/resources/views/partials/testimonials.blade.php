                    Just finished up my first project with the Ashmore team and wanted to share my appreciation for
                    the good business. Success is often driven by effective relationships, and Ashmore’s partnership
                    assisted me in strengthening my team all around. The process from beginning to end was smooth
                    and efficient. They are a great partner to have to create opportunities for rookie and veteran
                    investors.

                    If you are a newbie investor, I highly recommend Builders Trust Capital because your first few deals
                    will impact your outlook on real estate investment. If you are a seasoned investor, I also recommend
                    the company as they now offer products for both quick flips and long holds. This way you are covered
                    in both your entry and exit strategy. As a longtime client of Builders Trust Capital I can testify
                    that they are the real deal and there are genuinely good people behind this business.
